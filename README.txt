Several files: io - the File System, apps (contains test file), Disk implementation
There are some compilation issues due structs' management.
Please, read report about FS implementation and brainstorming

1. 'make' (gives compilation errors anyway)
2. execute test1.c in /apps
3. output shows what it does
